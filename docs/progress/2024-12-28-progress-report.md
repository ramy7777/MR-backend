# Progress Report - December 28, 2024

## Overview
This document outlines the progress made on the MR Platform project, focusing on issues encountered and their resolutions during the development process.

## Current Status
- Branch: `2_servers_working`
- Latest Commit: `80029cb` (fix: update API endpoints and port configuration to match backend server)

## Features Implemented
1. **User Management Interface**
   - Comprehensive user details view
   - Subscription information display
   - Device usage statistics
   - Action buttons for CRUD operations

2. **Customer Dashboard**
   - Real-time device status monitoring
   - Subscription details
   - Usage statistics visualization
   - Device management interface

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. User Management API Issues
#### Problem
- 404 errors when accessing user management endpoints
- Pagination warnings in the MUI DataGrid

#### Solution
- Updated API endpoints to include `/api` prefix
- Corrected pagination options in the DataGrid component
- Set initial page size to 10 and added 100 as a page size option

### 2. Authentication Issues
#### Problem
- Network errors during login attempts
- Token validation failures
- Connection refused errors on port 3001

#### Solution
- Fixed axios configuration to use correct base URL
- Properly configured authentication headers
- Ensured consistent port usage across the application

### 3. Dashboard Data Loading Issues
#### Problem
- Empty response errors from dashboard endpoints
- Duplicate `/api` prefix in requests
- Network errors when fetching dashboard data

#### Solution
- Removed duplicate `/api` prefix from request URLs
- Updated environment variables to use correct port
- Fixed backend route configuration for dashboard endpoints

## Configuration Changes Made
1. **Frontend Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // axios.ts
   baseURL: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3001/api'
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
   ```

3. **Backend Configuration**
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**
   - Verify all CRUD operations for user management
   - Test role-based access control
   - Validate dashboard data accuracy

2. **User Role Management**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add role management interface
   - Set up permission system

3. **Deployment**
   - Prepare for production deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure production environment variables

## Technical Debt
1. Need to implement comprehensive error handling
2. Add loading states for better UX
3. Implement request caching for dashboard data
4. Add unit tests for critical components

## Notes
- The application now uses a consistent port (3001) for the backend server
- Frontend development server continues to run on port 3000
- All API endpoints are properly prefixed with `/api`
- Authentication flow has been stabilized
